# google-homepage
first google-homepage TOP
 
 I deconstructed the first web page of Google and rebuilt it.
 I built a very basic form (it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

    I sticked a div onto the bottom and top of the page
    I identified the background color of an existing webpage
    I grabbed the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    I centered an element horizontally
    I included multiple ways of CSS styles in a page
    I understood how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
